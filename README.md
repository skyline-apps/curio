Welcome to Curio!

I&rsquo;ve always been an avid reader, and most of my education has come from the Internet. For a long time, I&rsquo;ve used read-it-later apps to keep track of what I&rsquo;ve read and highlight the most memorable parts. I built Curio as a passion project to make my reading experience even better, and I&rsquo;m excited to share it with you.

Curio provides a distraction-free reading experience for your favorite articles and newsletters across the web.
Save content from pages when you&rsquo;re on the go, and read it later in a beautiful, focused environment.
Add highlights, notes, and labels to organize your information diet.
Best of all, Curio is open-source, and its essential features will always be free for everyone to use:
- Saving articles from webpages
- Subscribing to email newsletters
- Adding notes, highlights, and labels to saved pages
- Searching over your article library

To get started using Curio, you can use the hosted app at [curi.ooo](https://curi.ooo) and read our [docs](https://curi.ooo/docs).
